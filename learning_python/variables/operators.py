# Explain: What is the difference between an operator and operand?
# Here is your starting code:
x = 5
y = 1

# Add code to demonstrate that you understand how use operators to:
# add
n = x + y
print("Sum", n)
# subtract
n = x - y
print("Subtract", n)
# multiply
n = x * y
print("Multiply", n)
# divide
n = x / y
print("Divide", n)
# find the remainder part of the division
n = x%y
print("Remainder", n)

# Add code to demonstrate that you understand how use comparison operators to:
# greater than
n = x > y
print("Grater than", n)
# less than
n = x < y
print("Less than", n)
# check if equal
n = x == y
print("Equal to", n)
# check if not equal
n = x != y
print("Not equal to", n)
# greater than or equal to
n = x >= y
print("Grater than or equal to", n)
# less than or equal to
n = x <= y
print("Less than or equal to", n)
