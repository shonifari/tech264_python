Sure, let's dive into JSON!

### What does it stand for?
**JSON** stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**.

### What is it used for?
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. It's commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing data.

### What is it written in?
JSON is a text format that is language-independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.

### Simple example of JSON
Here's a basic example of JSON representing a person:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false
}
```

### Advantages of using JSON
- **Human-readable**: Easy to read and write.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal syntax makes it efficient.
- **Language-independent**: Can be used with many programming languages.
- **Easy to parse**: Many languages have built-in libraries for parsing JSON.

### What data types can it store/use?
JSON can store the following data types:
- **String**
- **Number**
- **Object**
- **Array**
- **Boolean**
- **Null**Â²

### JSON syntax for:
#### Name-value pairs
```json
"firstName": "John"
```

#### Objects
Objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}` and contain name-value pairs:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

#### Separating data (key/value pairs)
Key/value pairs are separated by commas:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

#### JSON arrays
Arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]` and can contain multiple values, including objects:
```json
{
  "employees": [
    {"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"},
    {"firstName": "Anna", "lastName": "Smith"},
    {"firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Jones"}
  ]
}
```
