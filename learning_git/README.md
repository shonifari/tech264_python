# Basic Git understanding

Go to your folder of choice: 

```bash
cd /OneDrive/Documents/Github/tech264-test-git
```

## Initialise the repository: 

```bash
git init
```

## Add file to stage:
```bash
git add <file_path>
```

## Commit changes: 

```bash
git commit -m "<Commit message>"
```

## Check the changes

```bash
git log
```

## Switching branch or restoring files
The git checkout command is quite versatile in Git. Here are its primary uses:

* Switching Branches: You can use git checkout to switch between different branches in your repository. 
This will switch to the main branch.
```bash
git checkout main
```

* Creating New Branches: You can create and switch to a new branch in one step with git checkout -b new-branch .
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```
* Restoring Files: If you want to discard changes in your working directory and revert to the last committed state, you can use:
```bash
 git checkout -- <file>
```
* Checking Out Commits: You can also view a specific commit using hash: 
```bash
 git checkout <commit-hash> 
```


```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- README.md
```


## This command adds a remote repository to your local Git repository.
```bash
git remote add origin <github account>
```


## This command renames your current branch to main.
The -M flag is used to forcefully rename the branch.
```bash
git branch -M main
```


## This command pushes your local main branch to the remote repository named origin.
The -u flag sets the upstream tracking reference, meaning your local main branch will be linked to the remote main branch. This makes future pushes and pulls easier, as you wonâ€™t need to specify the branch name each time.
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Danger: If the sensitive file is still accessible in a previous commit
 
SOLUTION:
* Option 1: Remove previous commits with that file (e.g. use 'git reset' DANGEROUS - YOU COULD LOSE WORK)
```bash
git reset
```
* Option 2: 
  > 1. Remove GitHub repo (Now safe!)
  > 2. Remove sensitive from your local file
  > 3. Remove .git folder from your local repo
