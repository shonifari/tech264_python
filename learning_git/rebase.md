Sure! Let's break down Git rebase step by step.

### What Rebase Does
Rebase is a Git command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another. Unlike merging, which creates a new commit to combine the changes, rebasing moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit, effectively rewriting the project history.

### When to Use It
Rebase is particularly useful when you want to:
- **Maintain a linear project history**: This makes it easier to follow the project history and understand the changes.
- **Avoid merge commits**: If you prefer a cleaner history without the clutter of merge commits.
- **Update a feature branch**: When you want to incorporate changes from the main branch into your feature branch before merging it back.

### How It Works
Rebasing works by taking the commits from your current branch and reapplying them on top of another branch. Here’s a visual example:

#### Example
Imagine you have the following commit history:

```
A---B---C feature-branch
     \
      D---E main-branch
```

You want to rebase `feature-branch` onto `main-branch`. After rebasing, the history will look like this:

```
      A---B---C feature-branch
     /
D---E---A'---B'---C' main-branch
```

Here, `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` are new commits that represent the changes from `A`, `B`, and `C`, but based on `E`.

### Demo: Steps to Implement the Example

1. **Checkout the feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

2. **Rebase onto the main branch**:
   ```bash
   git rebase main-branch
   ```

### Handling Conflicts During Rebase
If you encounter conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause and allow you to resolve them. Here’s how to handle it:

1. **Resolve the conflicts**: Open the conflicting files and make the necessary changes.
2. **Add the resolved files**:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   ```
3. **Continue the rebase**:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### Aborting a Rebase
If you decide to abort the rebase, you can do so with:
```bash
git rebase --abort
```
